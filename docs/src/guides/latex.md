# LaTeX and typst

`latex` and `typst` code blocks can be marked with the `+render` attribute (see [highlighting](code-highlight.html)) to 
have them rendered into images when the presentation is loaded. This allows you to define formulas in text rather than 
having to define them somewhere else, transform them into an image, and them embed it.

## Dependencies

### typst

The engine used to render both of these languages is [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). _typst_ is easy to 
install, lightweight, and boilerplate free as compared to _LaTeX_.

### pandoc

For _LaTeX_ code rendering, besides _typst_ you will need to install [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc). How this 
works is the _LaTeX_ code you write gets transformed into _typst_ code via _pandoc_ and then rendered by using _typst_. 
This lets us:
* Have the same look/feel on generated formulas for both languages.
* Avoid having to write lots of boilerplate _LaTeX_ to make rendering for that language work.
* Have the same logic to render formulas for both languages, except with a small preparation step for _LaTeX_.

## Controlling PPI

_presenterm_ lets you define how many Pixels Per Inch (PPI) you want in the generated images. This is important because 
as opposed to images that you manually include in your presentation, where you control the exact dimensions, the images 
generated on the fly will have a fixed size. Configuring the PPI used during the conversion can let you adjust this: the 
higher the PPI, the larger the generated images will be.

Because as opposed to most configurations this is a very environment-specific config, the PPI parameter is not part of 
the theme definition but is instead has to be set in [_presenterm_'s config file](configuration.html):

```yaml
typst:
  ppi: 400
```

The default is 300 so adjust it and see what works for you.

## Image paths

If you're including an image inside a _typst_ snippet, you must:

* Use absolute paths, e.g. `#image("/image1.png")`.
* Place the image in the same or a sub path of the path where the presentation is. That is, if your presentation file is 
at `/tmp/foo/presentation.md`, you can place images in `/tmp/foo`, and `/tmp/foo/bar` but not under `/tmp/bar`. This is 
because of the absolute path rule above: the path will be considered to be relative to the presentation file's 
directory.

## Controlling the image size

You can also set the generated image's size on a per code snippet basis by using the `+width` modifier which specifies 
the width of the image as a percentage of the terminal size.

~~~markdown
```typst +render +width:50%
$f(x) = x + 1$
```
~~~

## Customizations

The colors and margin of the generated images can be defined in your theme:

```yaml
typst:
  colors:
    background: ff0000
    foreground: 00ff00

  # In points
  horizontal_margin: 2
  vertical_margin: 2
```

# Example

The following example:

~~~
# Formulas

```latex +render
\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1 \]
```
~~~

Is rendered like this:
