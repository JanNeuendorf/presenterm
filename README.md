_presenterm_ lets you create presentations in markdown format and run them from your terminal, with support for image 
and animated gifs, highly customizable themes, code highlighting, exporting presentations into PDF format, and 
plenty of other features. This is how the [demo presentation](/examples/demo.md) looks like:
